## SWCS

Code for my course **Softwarecraftmanship and Clean Code** at the universities:

* https://www.th-nuernberg.de/
* https://www.hs-ansbach.de/

## Study Programme Goals
Deepening of knowledge and practical skills in the field of software quality. Getting knowledge in tools and procedures from practice.

## Course Goals
Students acquire in-depth knowledge and skills for the analysis, assessment and improvement of software quality. You will be able to apply principles, patterns, techniques and tools needed to write clean code.

## Key Qualifications
Ability to think complex, ability to work independently, analysis and solution of problems.

## Course Contents
Software testing is not limited to a specific phase of the project. Already during the coding phase or the system build process critical and difficult to find software defects in the source code can be detected. The necessary procedures and tools are presented in the lecture.    

Among other things, the following topics will be covered:

- Overview of the basics of software quality 
- Software metrics, metric application in practice 
- Structured design, cohesion and coupling
- Overview of Principles, Best Practices and Code Smells 
- Compliance and verification of Java code conventions
- Static software testing, especially review techniques and static program analysis 
- Ensure software quality with tools such as SonarQube, PMD, SpotBugs, Checkstyle, ArchUnit and Dependency-Track
- Software tests with JUnit and Mockito
- Checking the test code coverage
- CI/CD
- Design Principles
- Design Patterns (GoF)
